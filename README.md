# Battleship

A project from The Odin Project to practice Test Driven Development (TDD).
If you have never played Battleship, here's how it works:

1. Place your 5 ships on the board
2. Attack the computer's board by clicking on the squares board.
3. Your goal is sink all your opponent's ships.
4. The computer will randomly attack your board the same way.
5. Who ever sinks all their opponent's ships win.
